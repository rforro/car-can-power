# CarCanPower

In modern cars power for accesories isn't regulated by turning the voltage off, but instead of it a CAN message with sleep is broadcasted to all devices. To not discharge the car battery too deeply when connecting external devices like for example bluetooth adapter a CAN sniffer was developed. It filters only single CAN message type which report state of key. If the key is inserted a gpio output is set to HIGH, which turns a relay and the power for external devices on. Removal of a key turns the power back off and protects the car battery from going flat.
